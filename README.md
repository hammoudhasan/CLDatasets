# Continual Learning Datasets üìö

Welcome to the Continual Learning Datasets repository! Here, we aim to make large-scale continual learning datasets easily accessible for everyone. Our repository provides a convenient way to download three large scale diverse datasets: CLOC, CGLM, and ImageNet2K. Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to our repo!

## Introduction üåü

In the world of continual learning, obtaining and working with large-scale datasets can be a challenging task. Our Continual Learning Datasets repository addresses the following issues faced by researchers and practitioners: Setting up large-scale continual learning datasets can often be cumbersome and involve complicated processing steps.

To make your journey smoother, we provide an easy-to-use solution for downloading and working with three prominent continual learning datasets: CLOC, CGLM, and ImageNet2K. These datasets offer a rich variety of real-world scenarios to explore and develop continual learning algorithms.

## Repository Structure üìÇ

The repository is structured as follows:

```
üì¶ CLDatasets
 ‚î£ üìÇ src
 ‚îÉ ‚î£ üìú downloader.py
 ‚îÉ ‚îó üìú dataloader.py
 ‚îó üìú README.md (You are here!)

```

- **src**: This directory contains the source code for downloading and creating the continual learning datasets.
  - `downloader.py`: Use this script to download any of the three datasets along with their order files.
  - `dataloader.py`: This script allows you to create the dataset easily within your code.

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started with Continual Learning Datasets, follow these simple steps:

1. Install other requirements by running:
```
pip install tqdm h5py Pillow datasets
```

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hammoudhasan/CLDatasets.git
```
3. Navigate to the `src` directory:
```bash
cd CLDatasets/src
```
3. Use the `downloader.py` script to download your desired dataset. Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
python downloader.py --dataset=<dataset_name> --directory=<directory> --unzip
```
   Replace `<dataset_name>` with either `CLOC`, `CGLM`, or `ImageNet2K`, depending on the dataset you want to download. `<directory>` should be the path where you want to store the dataset. Additionally, you can include the `--unzip` flag to automatically extract the downloaded files, which is recommended.

   Here's an example of how you could use the script to download the CLOC dataset:
   ```bash
   python downloader.py --dataset='CLOC' --directory='/data/cl_datasets/' --unzip
   ```

4. Once downloaded, you can use `dataloader.py` to easily incorporate the dataset into your code.

Note that datasets could also be found on [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hammh0a/CGLM)  for CGLM, [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hammh0a/CLOC) for CLOC and [this link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hammh0a/ImageNet2K) for ImageNet-2K dataset.
